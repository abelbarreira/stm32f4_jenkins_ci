# Setup Windows

The setup for Windows is still under defintion, but, I think:

- Compilers:
  - A good choice is [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) with [`UCRT64` environment](https://www.msys2.org/docs/environments/#__tabbed_1_1)
  - Path: `C:\\msys64\\usr\\bin`
- [ST-Link USB Driver for `STM32F407G-DISC1`](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link009.html)
- OpenOCD:
  - [Download pre-built OpenOCD for Windows](https://gnutoolchains.com/arm-eabi/openocd/) like `openocd-20250710.7z`
  - Path: `C:\\OpenOCD-20250710-0.12.0\\bin`
